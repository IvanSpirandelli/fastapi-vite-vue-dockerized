# fastapi-vite-vue-dockerized
This is a template project with a FastAPI (Python) backend and a Vite-Vue frontend. Frontend and backend are dockerized and the template contains  an example of  a get request. 

This setup was tested with:
```
@vue/cli 5.0.8
docker-compose version 1.26.2, build eefe0d31
fastapi==0.101.0
```

It is intended as a minimal base template.

Have fun.
